"""
MARK LIV — one-time setup.

Installs the Python dependencies for THIS operating system only: the OS-specific
packages in requirements.txt carry `sys_platform` markers, so a macOS or Linux
user never pulls Windows-only libraries (and vice-versa). Then it fetches the
Playwright browsers needed for web automation (current-OS builds only).

Two things it deliberately does NOT install:
  * the optional local wake word (custom "Hey Roohvi" model, or a stock phrase until you add one) — one-click, opt-in, from
    ⚙ → WAKE WORD inside the app;
  * anything for the avatar — the holographic head renders in software on the
    PyQt6 and numpy already listed here. No GPU, no OpenGL, no extra packages.
