"""
Holographic AI head for the HUD centre — the thing that used to be a ring stack
with the assistant's name in the middle.

Design notes
------------
* **The face is real human geometry.** `core.avatar_mesh` builds the head around
  MediaPipe's canonical face model, so eyelids, nostrils, lips and cheekbones
  are measured anatomy rather than fitted curves. This renderer's whole job is
  to light it, pose it and animate it.
* **Software rendered, on purpose.** Everything is QPainter, so there is no
  OpenGL context, no shader compile, no GPU driver to disagree with us and no
  new pip dependency. It looks the same on a gaming rig, a 2013 laptop, a VM
  and a remote desktop session.
* **Lip-sync comes from the audio pipeline, not from the avatar.** `main.py`
  already computes a real RMS level off the PCM (`_pcm_level`) for both the mic
  and JARVIS's own output. The avatar just consumes that number, so there is no
  second audio path to fall out of sync. The mouth only tracks the level while
  JARVIS is *speaking* — during listening the same level drives the aura, so the
  head never lip-syncs to the user's voice.

The renderer is theme-agnostic: `paint()` takes its colours as arguments, which
is what lets the HueWheel accent picker retint the avatar for free.

# vanished, at 12 ms it arrives, and going below that changes nothing because
# the analysis window is then the limit, not the smoothing. Halving it doubled
