"""
Telling the user's voice apart from our own coming back through the speakers.

What it is used for today
-------------------------
The *echo tail*: for a moment after a reply ends, sound is still leaving the
speakers, because writing to an audio device returns when the buffer accepts the
audio and not when the room has finished with it. Streaming the microphone
during that gap is how an assistant hears its own last sentence and answers
itself. This module lets the tail drop our own voice while still passing a user
who replies instantly, instead of blanket-muting.

Interrupting mid-sentence by voice is the other thing it can do, and everything
needed for it is here and tested — but it depends on the listener's room, so it
stays switched off until it can be tried on real hardware. See the note in
`_listen_audio` for how little it takes to turn back on.

The problem with a level test
-----------------------------
Deciding "the microphone is louder than the echo" needs to know how loud the
echo *is*, and that is not a constant. It depends on the speaker volume, where
the microphone sits, the room, whether headphones are plugged in, and whether
the user happens to have a hand over the mic. A single tuned number is wrong for
almost everyone: too eager on a loud desktop speaker, too deaf on a quiet laptop.

What this does instead
----------------------
Two independent signals, neither of which needs tuning per machine:

1. **Content.** Echo is not merely loud — it is *the same sound we just played*.
   Both streams are reduced to a handful of band energies, and then — rather
   than merely compared — as much of the recent output as fits is *subtracted*
   from the microphone block. Pure echo cancels to almost nothing. A second
   voice cannot be cancelled by ours, because its formants sit in bands where
   ours were weak, so it survives the subtraction. That distinction holds even
   when the two arrive at the same loudness, which is exactly the case a level
   test gets wrong.

2. **A learned echo gain.** Whenever the content check says "that is definitely
   just echo", the observed mic-to-output ratio is folded into a running
   estimate. The system therefore calibrates itself to the actual room within a
   few seconds of the first sentence, and re-calibrates when the volume changes
   or a hand covers the microphone.

Band energies rather than raw spectra also make the comparison sample-rate
agnostic, which matters here: the microphone runs at 16 kHz and playback at
24 kHz.
