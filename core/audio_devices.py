"""
core/audio_devices.py — pick which microphone and which speakers JARVIS uses.

WHY
    Both audio streams in main.py were opened without a `device=` argument, so
    they always took whatever the operating system called "default". On a laptop
    with a built-in mic, a webcam mic and a headset that is a coin toss — and on
    Windows the default *moves on its own* the moment you plug a headset in.
    "JARVIS can't hear me" almost always means "JARVIS is listening to the
    monitor's microphone".

WHY NAMES, NOT INDICES
    sounddevice identifies devices by integer index, and those indices shift
    whenever a device appears or disappears. Storing index 3 means that after
    unplugging a USB interface the saved setting silently points at something
    else. We store the device *name* and resolve it to an index at open time.

WHY THIS IS CACHED
    `sd.query_devices()` talks to the host audio API and can take a few hundred
    milliseconds on a Windows machine with many endpoints. Mark LV learned this
    lesson the expensive way — a 2.1-second `openwakeword` import on the Qt
    thread made the settings drawer look like it was broken. So the list is
    fetched once on a background thread at startup and served from cache.

# ── Why the raw list is unusable, and what is filtered out ───────────────────
#
# `sd.query_devices()` returns one entry per (device × host API), not one per
# device. Measured on a normal Windows machine: 41 entries for what the Windows
# sound settings show as 4 microphones and 4 speakers. The same Realtek
# microphone appears four times — once each under MME, DirectSound, WASAPI and
# WDM-KS — and none of the four is labelled to say which is which.
#
# Handing that to a person is not a choice, it is a quiz. So the list is reduced
# the way the operating system's own settings panel does it:
#
#   1. ONE host API per direction — chosen by measurement, not by reasoning.
#      See the preference note below.
#   2. No pseudo-devices. "Microsoft Sound Mapper", "Primary Sound Driver",
#      ALSA's "default"/"sysdefault"/"dmix" are aliases for "whatever the OS
#      picks" — which is precisely the "System default" entry already at the top
#      of the list. Offering them again as if they were hardware is noise.
#   3. No zero-channel or unnamed entries (WASAPI reports one of each).
#   4. Deduplicated by name.
#
# Nothing is hidden that a person could actually want: the same hardware is
# still there, listed once, under the name their operating system uses for it.

# ── Preference order, which is only a starting point ─────────────────────────
#
# Two earlier versions of this file were wrong in the same way: they decided
# which host API to use by reasoning about it instead of measuring it.
#
#   v1 ranked APIs by how clean their device names were and picked WASAPI.
#      WASAPI in shared mode does not resample — the hardware runs at 48 kHz,
#      this app streams 16 kHz in and 24 kHz out, and every open failed with
#      "Invalid sample rate". The picker looked right and did nothing.
#
#   v2 added a rate check and picked DirectSound, which passes that check on
#      both sides. PortAudio's DirectSound *output* is a silent sink: the
#      stream opens, every write returns success in ~0 ms, and nothing is ever
#      heard. Same failure, one layer deeper.
#
# So this list is a preference, not a promise. Which API actually gets used is
# decided below by _usable() (open it for real) and _transport_works() (does
# audio actually move), per direction. On this platform that lands on
# DirectSound for the microphone and MME for the speakers — a split that no
# amount of reasoning would have produced.
_PREFERRED_APIS = {
    "Windows": ("directsound", "mme", "wasapi"),
    # macOS has only Core Audio, so there is nothing to disambiguate.
    "Darwin":  ("core audio",),
    # PulseAudio/PipeWire present one clean endpoint per device; raw ALSA
    # presents dozens of routing permutations of the same card.
    "Linux":   ("pulse", "pipewire", "jack", "alsa"),
}

# ── "It opens" is not "it works" ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Opening a stream successfully proves nothing. Measured, writing 2.0 s of audio:
#
#     device=None (MME)                    2.02 s   consumed in real time
#     DirectSound, any output device       0.00 s   swallowed instantly
#
# No flag or capability field reports this. The only thing that separates a real
# sink from a fake one is whether it consumes audio at the rate audio is
# consumed at — so that is what gets measured, once per host API per direction,
# on the background thread at startup, using silence.
#
# Each direction is probed **the way main.py actually uses it**. That is not a
# detail: DirectSound input passes a callback stream and fails a blocking read,
# so an earlier version of this probe rejected a microphone that works perfectly
# in the app. Probe the mode you ship, not the mode that is easier to write.
