"""
Text → mouth shape, fused with the audio the avatar is actually speaking.

Why both sources
----------------
Formant analysis of the audio (see `_pcm_visemes` in main.py) gives excellent
*timing* and a decent read on vowels, but it is blind to exactly the consonants
lip-reading depends on. /m/, /b/ and /p/ are made with the lips pressed shut,
and nothing in the spectrum reliably says "the lips are closed" — a nasal /m/
and a nasal /n/ look nearly identical to a filter bank while looking completely
different on a face.

The transcript knows those consonants for certain. So the text supplies *which
shape*, the audio supplies *when* and *how strongly*, and the two are blended.
If the transcript is late or missing the mouth silently falls back to the
audio-only shape, which is what the previous version did on its own.

Language independence
---------------------
There is no per-language table here. Every character is reduced to one of the
26 bare Latin letters — by Unicode decomposition for accents, by transliteration
for Cyrillic and Greek — and articulation is looked up on that. So Turkish,
English, German, French, Spanish, Polish, Vietnamese, Russian, Ukrainian and
Greek all work from the same twenty-odd rules, and adding a language costs
nothing because there is nothing to add.

Scripts whose spelling does not reveal pronunciation (CJK, Arabic, Devanagari,
Hebrew, Thai) are detected by coverage and skipped, and the mouth runs on the
audio-only shape — which is itself language-independent, being physics. The
result is never wrong, only less detailed.
